Jetpack Pro Class Case Studies, but made with clean arch, and some security and performance add-ons.

This app uses themoviedb API for its data, and uses ReactiveX + Retrofit + Room. insert-koin (Koin) is used for Injection purposes.

Ultimately, this is not a Jetpack Pro Class Case Study. Instead, its the Android Expert Class Case Study project.
